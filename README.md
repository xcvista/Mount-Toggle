Mount Toggle
============
This is a little utility tool for OS X users who need to mount/unmount a partition frequently with OSXFuse. This tool will automatically mount and unmount the partition in question in a single click. You may need to change this app using Automator before use.

I created this tool to allow easier mounting of my Ubuntu partition on OS X using ext4fuse over OSXFuse.
